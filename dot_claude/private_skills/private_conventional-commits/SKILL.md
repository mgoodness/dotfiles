# Conventional Commits

Structured commit messages that enable automated changelogs and semantic versioning.

## When to Activate

- Writing any git commit message
- Reviewing commit history for consistency
- Setting up CI/CD that parses commits
- Deciding version bumps based on changes

## Commit Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Types

| Type       | Purpose                                                 | SemVer |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `feat`     | New feature or capability                               | MINOR  |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                                 | PATCH  |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                                      | —      |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace, semicolons (no logic change)    | —      |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature | —      |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                                 | —      |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                                | —      |
| `build`    | Build system or external dependencies                   | —      |
| `ci`       | CI configuration and scripts                            | —      |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks, tooling, config                      | —      |

## Scope

Optional noun in parentheses describing the affected area:

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow
fix(api): handle empty response body
docs(readme): update installation steps
refactor(db): extract connection pooling
```

## Description

- Imperative mood: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Lowercase first letter
- No period at end
- Keep under 72 characters

## Body

- Separated from description by a blank line
- Explain **what** and **why**, not how
- Free-form, can be multi-paragraph
- Wrap at 72 characters

## Footer

- Separated from body by a blank line
- Git trailer format: `Token: value` or `Token #value`
- Use hyphens in multi-word tokens (except `BREAKING CHANGE`)

```

## Breaking Changes

Two ways to indicate a breaking change (MAJOR version bump):

```
# Option 1: ! after type/scope
feat(api)!: change authentication to OAuth2-only

# Option 2: BREAKING CHANGE footer
feat(api): change authentication to OAuth2-only

BREAKING CHANGE: basic auth is no longer supported, all clients must use OAuth2
```

Both can be combined. The `!` draws attention in `git log --oneline`.

## Examples

```
feat(markets): add cursor-based pagination to list endpoint

Replace offset pagination with cursor-based for consistent performance
on large datasets. Existing offset params still work but are deprecated.

Refs: #456
```

```
fix(auth): prevent token refresh race condition

Multiple concurrent requests could trigger parallel refresh calls,
causing token invalidation. Use mutex to serialize refresh.
```

```
chore: upgrade Go to 1.23
```

```
feat!: drop support for Node 18

BREAKING CHANGE: minimum Node version is now 20 LTS
```

```
docs(api-design): add rate limiting section
```

## Rules

1. Every commit MUST have a type prefix
2. Type MUST be followed by optional scope, optional `!`, then `: `
3. `feat` = MINOR, `fix` = PATCH, `BREAKING CHANGE` = MAJOR
4. Scope MUST be a noun in parentheses if present
5. Description MUST immediately follow the `: ` separator
6. Body MUST begin one blank line after description
7. Footers MUST begin one blank line after body
8. Breaking changes MUST be indicated by `!` and/or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
9. Commits without `feat` or `fix` types do not trigger version bumps
